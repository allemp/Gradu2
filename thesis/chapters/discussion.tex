\section{Related Work}

To find relevant related work both reverse snowballing and forward snowballing is used on a set of MLOps papers previously known to the author.

Cardoso Silva et al. \parencite*{cardososilvaBenchmarkingMachineLearning2020} in their paper identify key system metrics for monitoring a production machine learning system. Key metrics identified include task completion time, CPU and GPU usage, memory usage, disk input/output and network traffic and their collection was implemented in a tool called \emph{Ubenchmark} \parencite{cardososilvaBenchmarkingMachineLearning2020}. The researchers in particular focus on empirically monitoring and performance benchmarking of the machine learning system.

Karl et al. \parencite*{karlMultiObjectiveHyperparameterOptimization2023} in their overview paper approach additional performance requirements such as energy efficiency, inference latency or memory consumption hyperparameter search through a multi-objective optimization lens.
