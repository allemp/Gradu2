\begin{itemize}
    \item Problem with MLOps/ML tools
        \begin{itemize}
            \item traditional ML performance metrics such as accuracy
            \item fancy features such as neural architecture search, AutoML, performance tuning
            \item fancy techniques such as early stopping, grid search, bayesian optimization search etc.
            \item little support for non-ML metrics: CPU util, memory used, latency, throughput (images/s etc.), hardware required (CPU, GPU, TPU etc.)
            \item ML in production has many objectives besides accuracy for example: satellite image processing model A took 4-5h and model B took 5min. Model A is infeasible in production despite being more accurate.
            \item "Better' depends on the specific application
        \end{itemize}
    \item Hypothesis: Early stopping will speed up computing non-ML metrics (CPU util, Memory use, GPU/TPU requirement, latency, throughput)
\end{itemize}
